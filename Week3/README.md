This week we will first study another component of the competitions: the evaluation metrics. We will recap the most prominent ones and then see, how we can efficiently optimize a metric given in a competition.
KEY CONCEPTS
* Describe the role of correct metric optimization method in a competition
* Analyze new metrics
* Create constant baselines
* Recall the most important classification and regression metrics
* Describe what libraries can be used to optimize a particular metric
