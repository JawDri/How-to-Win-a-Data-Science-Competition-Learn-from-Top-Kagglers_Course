This week we will introduce competitive data science. We will learn about competitions' mechanics, the difference between competitions and a real life data science, hardware and software that people usually use in competitions. We will also briefly recap major ML models frequently used in competitions.

KEY CONCEPTS
* Describe competition mechanics
* Compare real life applications and competitions
* Summarize reasons to participate in data science competitions
* Describe main types of ML algorithms
* Describe typical hardware and software requirements
* Analyze decision boundaries of different classifiers
* Use standard ML libraries
