In this module we will talk about hyperparameter optimization process. We will also see some practical tips and tricks.

KEY CONCEPTS
* List most important hyperparameters in major models; describe their impact
* Understand the hyperparameter tuning process in general
* Arrange hyperparameters by their importance
